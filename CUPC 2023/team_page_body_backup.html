<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome, everyone! This fall, the University of Waterloo will be hosting the Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference (CUPC). Our skilled and dedicated team is excited to highlight what our city and campus can offer, while showcasing some of the exceptional research being done by the Canadian physics community. We hope to provide delegates with an enjoyable and memorable conference experience in the safest manner possible. </span> Below are profiles of the CUPC organizing team members - we can't wait to meet you in late October! <br /><a href="https://cupc.cap.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CUPC2023Group_6163Simple-scaled.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2498 aligncenter" src="https://cupc.cap.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CUPC2023Group_6163Simple-1024x512.jpg" alt="" width="682" height="341" /></a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 0px;">Hello! I’m Courtney and I’m going into my 3rd year here at Waterloo! I love physical chemistry, electricity and magnetism, and anything I can experimentally determine! Ultimately, I want to help determine how things interact with each other and how that influences our daily lives. My career goals are to go into the development of improved circuit components or anything electricity related.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><br />Outside of being a physics nerd, I play D&amp;D (path of the barbarian which is so fun), watch speedruns of Nintendo games, lift at the gym, and bake. So even in my free time, I’m still a nerd. I’m in charge of internal affairs for CUPC this year, meaning my job is to make sure everything runs smoothly and all the execs know what’s happening. My favourite part of my job is making spreadsheets to keep us organized! If you see me at CUPC, say hi and let me know your favourite baked goods or your favourite weight lift!</p>

This of course led to a lot of broken appliances around the house that I eventually did put back together once I was actually able to (sorry mum)!<br /><br />As volunteer coordinator, I'll be helping out with managing our fantastic team of volunteers who are going to help make this conference run as smoothly as possible!
