                <p>Hi! I'm Gabe, and I'm in my third year of Physics and Astronomy at UW. I've always been in awe of the beauty of the universe, and physics gives me the tools and language to explore it. I'm especially interested in high energy physics and widening the cracks in the Standard Model, but I've also gained a keen interest in Quantum Information during my co-ops. I dream of working on one of the LHC experiments at CERN. Aside from several extracurriculars, in my spare time I love reading, coding, and cooking for my wife. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    As Co-Vice Chair with Izzy, I manage communications with the venue and invitee selection, as well as co-ordinate tasks between members of the CUPC2023 Executive Committee. I meet regularly with the Committee, the other Chairs, and the Canadian Association of Physicists (CAP) to plan this event and make things run smoothly behind the scenes. If you see me around at this year's conference, ask me about my research with the Institute for Quantum Computing!

                <p>Hello! I’m Courtney and I’m going into my 3rd year here at Waterloo! I love physical chemistry, electricity and magnetism, and anything I can experimentally determine! Ultimately, I want to help determine how things interact with each other and how that influences our daily lives. My career goals are to go into the development of improved circuit components or anything electricity related.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Outside of being a physics nerd, I play D&D (path of the barbarian which is so fun), watch speedruns of Nintendo games, lift at the gym, and bake. So even in my free time, I’m still a nerd. I’m in charge of internal affairs for CUPC this year, meaning my job is to make sure everything runs smoothly and all the execs know what’s happening. My favourite part of my job is making spreadsheets to keep us organized! If you see me at CUPC, say hi and let me know your favourite baked goods or your favourite weight lift!

                <p>Hello folks! My name is Ameen and I’m a fourth year Mathematical Physics student at Waterloo. Curiosity is what brought me to pursue a degree in physics as I love trying to understand why things work the way they do. This of course led to a lot of broken appliances around the house that I eventually did put back together once I was actually able to (sorry mum)!
                    <br/><br/>
                    As volunteer coordinator, I’ll be helping out with managing our fantastic team of volunteers who are going to help make this conference run as smoothly as possible! If you do see me around definitely do say hello!
                    <br/><br/>
                    During my spare time, I enjoy reading, cooking and playing music; currently trying to teach myself piano. Looking forward to seeing you all at the conference!

                <p>Hello everyone! I’m Jamiel, a fourth-year physics student at the University of Waterloo. Physics has always been a passion of mine because it is a massive field of science with applications in everything we touch! I chose to pursue a general physics degree without any specialization because I wanted the flexibility to learn about different fields. My coops have all been in different research fields in physics, with quantum optics, particle accelerators, and recently, medical physics. After my undergraduate degree, I hope to continue my medical physics work in grad school. Here at UWaterloo I am also involved in the skateboarding club, and I also like to do photography in my free time, both of which I would love to chat about.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This year’s CUPC will not be possible without the help of many volunteers, and as a Volunteer Coordinator, I will be helping to ensure that all the volunteers create an environment that is fun and safe for the attendees. Come say hi if you see me at the conference!

                <p>Hello! My name is Anthony Girmenia. I’m a fourth-year Physics and Astronomy student here at the University of Waterloo. I was initially drawn to physics because I loved the idea of being a researcher. I wanted to work on the frontier of humanity’s knowledge of the world, solving problems that nobody has solved before! I was particularly interested in astronomy, as it is a playground of exciting and profound questions about the universe.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Through my coursework and co-op experience, I have developed a specific interest in the solar system and exoplanets. I want to learn about the processes that created the world we live on, and if similar worlds exist somewhere out there in the galaxy. Outside of school, I do a variety of hobbies, including playing guitar, chess, videogames, skateboarding, and more! I love learning new things, and hearing about other people’s hobbies!
                    <br/><br/>
                    As a volunteer coordinator, I will be leading a team of volunteers who will be ensuring CUPC is a safe and enjoyable experience for everybody. If you see me around, feel free to stop me for a chat!
