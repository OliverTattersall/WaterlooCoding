    "- Prioritize reviewing the lecture slides from all units, with a special focus on the material covered after the midterm. Additionally, revisit and thoroughly understand the assignments and lab exercises associated with each topic, as they are essential for practical understanding.\n",
    "- The goal of this session is to guide you through the approaches for solving problems and effective studying techniques for the exam. It's important to grasp the underlying concepts and problem-solving strategies rather than relying on rote memorization of specific solutions."
